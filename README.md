# HomeTownApp
An early challenge of the **Udacity FEND program**, this provided website is
manipulated with responsive design principles to execute in an appealing manner
across different viewport sizes. The site represents a glimpse into the happenings
of a town with news, weather, and sports.

## Viewing
As this is a website that has been created to be viewed on varying screen sizes,
it should work in any form of browser window. Just open _index.html_ with your
browser of choice.

## Known Bugs
**2018/05/25:** 1. Between 301 and 445px, "Hero image" is actually larger than
the content of the page (evidenced by header box being shorter than width). Not
sure what's going on here. 2. Scores - "winner" name not bolded, ever. 3. Scores -
short name does not appear under 300px.

**2018/05/22:** FIXED (missing curly bracket): I broke the responsive flow, the
hamburger button does not hide at viewport width greater than 600px nor does it
maintain declared size.

## License
As most of the starter code was provided by the **Udacity** course, I cannot take
credit for most of the HTML and CSS. I have contributed further CSS stylings as
well as all of the Javascript for this site. As this has all been done for
educational purposes, this site falls under "fair use," with the exception of
code and graphics actually created by me. All I ask is for an attribution with a
link back here.
